lcc-sentiment
=============

Sentiment annotation of The Leipzig Corpora Collection.

Manual sentiment annotation by Finn Ã…rup Nielsen of Danish sentences.

Data
----
The data is directly derived from The Leipzig Corpora Collection which is downloadable from http://corpora2.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/download.html.
The format in the data files is changed slightly from tab-separated to comma-separated and an column header is added.
An extra column is introduced called 'valence'.
This contains the sentiment scoring. 
The scoring follows the pattern from AFINN with integer scoring from -5 to +5,
though for most sentence, if any, the full range of the score is not used. 

An example in Python with the Pandas for reading the data with the read_csv function is shown in the Jupyter Notebook.
